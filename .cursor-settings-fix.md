# Fixing Cursor "Commit & Push" Button Loop Issue

## Problem
The Commit & Push button in Cursor IDE is stuck in a loop/continuously running.

## Solutions to Try:

### Solution 1: Disable Auto-Commit/Push (Recommended)
1. Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
2. Search for "git" or "commit"
3. Disable these settings:
   - `git.enableSmartCommit` → set to `false`
   - `git.autoCommit` → set to `false`
   - `git.autoFetch` → set to `false`
   - `git.postCommitCommand` → set to `none`
   - `scm.autoReveal` → set to `false`

### Solution 2: Clear Git Cache
The repository has many changes. Try:
```bash
cd /home/htmaldives/rent-management
git status --porcelain | wc -l  # Check how many files changed
```

### Solution 3: Check Cursor Git Extensions
1. Open Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
2. Disable any Git-related extensions temporarily
3. Restart Cursor

### Solution 4: Restart Cursor
Sometimes Cursor's git state gets stuck:
1. Close Cursor completely
2. Restart Cursor
3. The button should reset

### Solution 5: Use Git Command Line Instead
If button keeps looping, use terminal:
```bash
cd /home/htmaldives/rent-management
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

### Solution 6: Check Git Hooks
Your repo has a post-checkout hook that might interfere:
- File: `.git/hooks/post-checkout`
- You can temporarily rename it: `mv .git/hooks/post-checkout .git/hooks/post-checkout.disabled`
